#summary This page is a list of people who've signed the Contributor License Agreement.

= Introduction =

Thanks for thinking of contributing to Breakpad! Unfortunately there are some pesky legal issues to get out of the way, but they're quick and painless.

If you're doing work individually, not as part of any employment, you'll need to sign the individual Contributor License Agreement:

(this one can be done electronically).

If you're contributing to Breakpad as part of your employment with another organization, you'll need to sign a Corporate Contributor License Agreement.

(this one has to be faxed in, unfortunately)

IMPORTANT: To clarify, the authors(you!) of the contributions will maintain all copyrights; the agreements you sign will grant rights to Google to use your work. 

Thanks, and if you have any questions let me know and I'll loop in the legal guy here to get you an answer.
